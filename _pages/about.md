Urrr... I have many English nicknames (Perditio, Oliver, Yasgant, dqtr03, etc.). Perditio is the one if I want to be somehow unique.

Anyway. I'm Yang Yiliu, a year 3 UG majoring in Artificial Intelligence from CUHK.

My research interests are computational theory and system design. I won a lot of prizes during my senior high and UG. If you are interested in this, please refer to my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yyiliu).

I have been a member of CUHK ICPC team since Sep 2020 and got bronze awards in the 2022 Macau and Kunming Regionals. I joined Tencent's [AI Arena Multi-Agent Competition](https://aiarena.tencent.com/aiarena/en/match/fisu) this spring and got a high rank.

I also participated in the Summer Research Internship in 2021 and 2022 summer. The project topics are "Efficient Graph Pattern Matching System" and "Continual Learning Knowledge Graph Embeddings" correspondingly. I won the Best Project Award for the latter project.

Beyond the class, I have studied many courses on the Internet. You can see [here]({% link progress.md %}) to take a look at my study progress. If you are interested in these things, feel free to email me or send me messages via wechat so that we can discuss our ideas.

I was developing an AI to play an STG video game ([GitHub](https://github.com/Yasgant/project-nmnbns)). However, the project is paused due to my knowledge and time limitations. If anyone has an interest in it, please let me know.
