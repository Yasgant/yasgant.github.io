I'm Yang Yiliu (Oliver), a third-year undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I am interested in theoretical computer science (influenced by my previous experience in OI) and reinforcement learning.

My research experiences were mainly in 2 summer research internships. I won the best project award because of the 2022 one titled "Continual Learning Knowledge Graph Embeddings".

I have been a member of CUHK ICPC team since 2020 and got 3 bronze medals in multiple regionals.

Beyond the class, I also studied some online or graduate-level courses. You can see [here](table) to take a look at my study table.

I love collecting small awards/prizes. If you are interested in this, please refer to my [Info](info) page.

I was doing a reinforcement learning model to play an STG game ([GitHub](https://github.com/Yasgant/project-nmnbns)). However, this project was paused due to my lack of time. If anyone has an interest in it, please let me know.
